# Hi-Lo Multi-Threaded Game
## 📌 Overview

This project is a Hi-Lo number guessing game implemented using POSIX threads (pthreads). It explores thread-based concurrency, providing a more lightweight alternative to process-based execution, while addressing synchronization and shared resource management.

The project demonstrates:

--Thread creation and management

--Shared memory and synchronization

--Performance trade-offs compared to process-based implementation

## 🛠 Features

--Multi-threaded architecture using pthreads

--Shared memory for game state

--Synchronization to prevent race conditions

--Configurable difficulty and guessing range

## ⚙️ Technologies

--Language: C

--Concurrency: POSIX Threads

--Synchronization: Mutex locks (if implemented)

--Platform: Linux / UNIX-like systems

## 🚀 Getting Started
✅ Prerequisites

--GCC compiler

--Linux/UNIX environment

--POSIX thread support (usually included in Linux)

## 🔧 Build and Run
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hi-lo-multi-threaded-game.git

cd hi-lo-multi-threaded-game

./hi_lo_thread

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

--Implementing concurrency using threads

--Synchronization techniques in multi-threaded programs

--Performance differences between threads and processes
